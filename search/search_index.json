By assessing various technology options like fibre, cellular networks, point-to-point microwave, and satellite, the platform identifies the best way to bring connectivity to unconnected areas. The platform evaluates the costs of each solution and provides a deployment plan that meets the cost limits you set. The platform uses your data on the locations of Points of Interest (POIs), ICT infrastructure (cell sites and tranmission nodes), and mobile coverage. Additionally, it uses open data on population, road networks and topography to enrich the analysis, making it a powerful solution for planning affordable, efficient internet connectivity. The Platform Model Dataset Upload : Begin by uploading your datasets to the platform. The data will be processed and cleaned to ensure it is ready for analysis. If you have previously uploaded the required datasets, you may skip this step. Project Creation : Create a new project and assign it a name. Scenario Selection : Select a scenario for your project. Scenarios define the logic used to assign technology options to Points of Interest (POIs). For example, the Maximise Operator Net Present Value (NPV) scenario chooses the set of technology options that jointly maximise operator profits. At this stage, you will also set scenario parameters\u2014such as the planning period, budget, and throughput demand per user\u2014and choose which technology options to include in your analysis.

By minimizing the total length of fibre required, this model reduces overall deployment costs while efficiently extending connectivity. To start with, the model connects POIs and fibre nodes to the existing road network using straight lines (unless they are already on the road network). Then, for each unconnected POI, it computes the shortest path to all fibre nodes. POIs that are already connected to the fibre network can also act as fibre nodes, from which the fibre network can be extended. Figure: Graph initialization and fibre path algorithm At each step of the algorithm, new connections are made between connected and unconnected points as long as the length of the new connection is below a specified threshold. For example, it can be specified that no single fibre line should be longer than 5 kilometres. This approach enables economies of scale: POIs can act as relay points for neighbouring POIs, enabling connectivity without each one needing to connect directly to a transmission node. This approach optimises resource usage and simplifies network expansion. In practice, this model is an application of Kruskal's algorithm to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in a network graph, where the edges are the road network and the vertices are POIs and fibre nodes. The MST ensures the minimal fibre path necessary to connect all relevant points while adhering to road network constraints related to distance. Figure: Output of fibre path algorithm Feasibility Fibre is considered a feasible technology for a POI if the algorithm is able to connect that POI to the fibre network, given the algorithm constraints - particularly the maximum length of fibre allowed per connection. In practice, fibre will not be feasible for POIs that are very far away from transmission nodes or other POIs.

Figure: Cellular cost function Point-to-Point The point-to-point model evaluates the feasibility of establishing radio links between points of interest (POIs) and cell sites using visibility analysis. This involves assessing whether the line of sight between a POI and a cell site is obstructed, ensuring that only feasible links are considered for deployment. The analysis uses open topography data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which provides 30-meter resolution elevation data. The maximum visibility limit is set at 35 kilometres, meaning that cell sites beyond this distance are not considered visible or feasible for point-to-point connectivity.

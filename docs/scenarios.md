# Scenarios

The tool provides built-in connectivity scenarios to guide the analysis. Each scenario defines how the connectivity models are parameterized and determines the best technologies to use for connecting points of interest (POIs) according to a specific logic. Details of the available scenarios are outlined below.

## Minimize Total Cost of Ownership
